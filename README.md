<h3># FanFinder<br>

For project #1, I created a simple Fan Finder app. 

-Once players come to the site the they are taken to a landing page where there is an ENTER button.

-Once they click the ENTER button they are taken to the USER INDEX page, where you can go to a specific users favorite venues, you can add a user, edit a user, OR delete a user.

-Next to each users name is a link you can click on to see there favorite venues(where they most enjoy watching their favorite team play), you will see the name of the venue and whether they serve alcohol or not. Because that's an important part of watching your favorite team play

-From the Favorite venues list, you can click on the "games" link to see the list of games they're playing and whether the game that you want to see is on the speaker or not. or you can click (back to users) link to go back to the USER INDEX.

-When you click on the [DELETE] button under the user name, the user is deleted.
-When you click on the Add link under the user name, you will be taken to a form where you can create a new user.
-When you click on the [EDIT] button, you will be taken to a form where you can edit a users information.
